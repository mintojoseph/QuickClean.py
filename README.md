QuickClean.py
=============

A quick and effective way to nuke-clean those folders that get really cluttered really fast (ahem, I'm looking at you /Downloads!)
Preferably used in cohesion with a [cron job](http://www.generateit.net/cron-job/) script or task scheduler at intervals of your convenience 

When run, this tool moves sorts all your music, pictures, videos, and documents into the folders you instruct them to go to.

Usage
-----
	$$python QuickClean.py -s [path to directory to be cleaned] -m [music directory] -p [pictures directory] -v [videos directory] -d [documents directory]
